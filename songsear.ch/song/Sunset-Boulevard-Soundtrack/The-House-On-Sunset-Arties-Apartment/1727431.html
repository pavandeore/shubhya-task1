MAX is busying himself, preparing the drinks tray.<br/>JOE<br/>Max<br/>You&#x27;ve pulled the stops out.<br/>It looks like gala night aboard S.S. Titanic.<br/>Will we<br/>play spot the actor?<br/>As if we&#x27;re visiting a gallery of waxworks?<br/>MAX<br/>Would you rather<br/>I mix for you a dry martini<br/>or shall I open a champagne?<br/>JOE<br/>Max, don&#x27;t be evasive<br/>who&#x27;s she invited to the ball?<br/>MAX<br/>Madame herself made every call.<br/>(Suddenly, NORMA appears at the top of the stairs in a dazzling diamente evening gown with long black gloves and bird of paradise feathers in her hair. SHE begins a stately descent. JOE puts his glass down and applauds. MAX watches discreetly, evidently moved; HE opens a bottle of champagne.<br/>JOE waits to meet her at the bottom of the stairs. HE&#x27;s reaching out to take her arm, when as if from nowhere, SHE suddenly produces a gold cigarette case and hands it to him.)<br/>NORMA<br/>Here. Happy New Year.<br/>JOE<br/>Norma, I can&#x27;t take this.<br/>NORMA<br/>Oh, shut up. Open it. Read what it says.<br/>(JOE opens it and reads out, half-amused and half-appalled.)<br/>JOE<br/>&quot;Mad about the boy&quot;<br/>NORMA<br/>Yes, and you do look absolutely divine.<br/>(JOE is touched, despite his embarrassment; HE decides to give in gracefully and slips the cigarette case into his pocket.)<br/>JOE<br/>Well, thank you.<br/>(NORMA stretches out a hand to lead JOE onto the freshly-waxed tiles dance-floor.)<br/>NORMA<br/>I had these tiles put in, you know, because Rudy Valentino said to me, it takes tiles to tango. Come on.<br/>JOE<br/>No, no, not on the same floor as Valentino!<br/>NORMA<br/>Oh come on, come on, come on. Get up. Follow me. And one, two.... and one, two, one, two together. And one.<br/>(THEY begin to dance. After a while, NORMA snaps at JOE.)<br/>Don&#x27;t lean back like that.<br/>JOE<br/>Norma, it&#x27;s that thing. It tickles.<br/>(NORMA pulls the feathers out of her hair and casts them aside. THEY resume dancing, closer this time.)<br/>NORMA<br/>Ring out the old<br/>Ring in the new<br/>A midnight wish<br/>to share with you<br/>Your lips are warm<br/>my head is light;<br/>were we alive<br/>before tonight?<br/>I don&#x27;t need a crowded ballroom<br/>everything I want is here<br/>If you&#x27;re with me<br/>next year will be<br/>the perfect year<br/>(JOE is beginning to be aware what&#x27;s happening; still, at the same time, HE&#x27;s caught up in the intoxication of the movement.)<br/>JOE<br/>Before we play<br/>some dangerous game;<br/>before we fan<br/>some harmless flame,<br/>we have to ask<br/>if this is wise<br/>and if the game<br/>is worth the prize.<br/>With this wine and with this music,<br/>how can anything be clear?<br/>Let&#x27;s wait and see<br/>it may just be<br/>the perfect year.<br/>(THEY dance.)<br/>NORMA<br/>It&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve<br/>and hope are high,<br/>Dance one year in,<br/>kiss one good-bye.<br/>Another chance,<br/>another start,<br/>so many dreams<br/>to tease the heart.<br/>We don&#x27;t need a crowded ballroom<br/>everything we want is here<br/>and face to face<br/>we will embrace<br/>the perfect year.<br/>We don&#x27;t need a crowded ballroom<br/>everything we want is here<br/>and face to face<br/>we will embrace<br/>the perfect year.<br/>(SHE kisses him lightly as the number comes to an end. Then, as the orchestra strikes up the next piece, THEY move off the floor to take up the glasses of champagne which MAX has poured for them. They clink glasses and drink.)<br/>JOE<br/>So, what time are they supposed to get here?<br/>NORMA<br/>Who?<br/>JOE<br/>The other guests.<br/>NORMA<br/>There are no other guests. Just you and me.<br/>(SHE leans in to kiss him again, this time more seriously. MAX half turns away, averting his eyes.)<br/>I&#x27;m in love with you. Surely you know that.<br/>(JOE is terribly startled by this.)<br/>JOE<br/>Norma....<br/>NORMA<br/>We&#x27;ll have a wonderful time next year. I&#x27;ll have the pool filled up for you. I&#x27;ll open up my house in Malibu, and you can have the whole ocean. I have enough money to buy us anything we want.<br/>JOE<br/>Cut out that &quot;us&quot; business.<br/>NORMA<br/>What&#x27;s the matter with you?<br/>JOE<br/>What right do you have to take me for granted?<br/>NORMA<br/>What right? Do you want me to tell you?<br/>(JOE is out of his depth now; all he can do is bluster.)<br/>JOE<br/>Norma, what I&#x27;m trying to say is that I&#x27;m the wrong guy for you; you need a big shot, someone with polo ponies, a Valentino...<br/>NORMA<br/>What you&#x27;re trying to say is, you don&#x27;t want me to love you. Say it! Say it!<br/>(JOE doesn&#x27;t answer; he looks away, avoiding her eye. Thus, it takes him a completely by surprise when SHE slaps his face. And, before HE can react, SHE&#x27;s turned and run all the way up the stairs to vanish into her bedroom. JOE finds himself standing face to face with MAX.)<br/>JOE<br/>Max. Get me a taxi.<br/>(As MAX moves towards the phone, the house moves back a way to reveal ARTIE&#x27;s apartment, a modest one-room affair, packed to the rafters with carefree young people, many of whom we have already encountered at the studio and at Schwab&#x27;s. Several of the GUESTS cluster around the piano and there&#x27;s a BOY with a saxophone. Others help themselves to some dangerous looking alcoholic concoction from a punchbowl. The house at Sunset remains visible throughout.<br/>As the new scene establishes itself, JOE encases himself in his vicuna coat.)<br/>I had to get out<br/>I needed<br/>to be with people my own age<br/>to hear the sound of laughter<br/>and mix with hungry actors,<br/>underemployed composers,<br/>nicotine-poisoned writers,<br/>real people,<br/>real problems,<br/>having a really good time.<br/>(JOE hesitates in the doorway of the apartment, suddenly embarrassed by how overdressed HE is. Meanwhile, ARTIE hails him and pushes through the crowd to greet him.)<br/>ARTIE<br/>Hey, Gillis! We&#x27;d given you up.<br/>(BETTY, by the piano, hears this and looks around, delighted to see JOE. By now, ARTIE has reached him.)<br/>Let me take your coat.<br/>(HE touches the coat and reacts, surprised.)<br/>Jesus, Joe, what&#x27;s this made of? Mink?<br/>(HE&#x27;s even more surprised when the coat comes off to reveal JOE&#x27;s tails.)<br/>Who did you borrow this from? Adolphe Menjou?<br/>JOE<br/>Close, but no cigar.<br/>(HE gestures around the room.)<br/>Hey!

Presently MAX appears, supporting NORMA. Her wrists are heavily bandaged; SHE looks much older, frail and shaky. With infinite tenderness, MAX shepherds NORMA to the old sofa near the piano, out of site of the orchestra.

Titanic.<br/>Will we<br/>play spot the actor?<br/>As if we&#x27;re visiting a gallery of waxworks?<br/>MAX<br/>Would you rather<br/>I mix for you a dry martini<br/>or shall I open a champagne?<br/>JOE<br/>Max, don&#x27;t be evasive<br/>who&#x27;s she invited to the ball?<br/>MAX<br/>Madame herself made every call.<br/>(Suddenly, NORMA appears at the top of the stairs in a dazzling diamente evening gown with long black gloves and bird of paradise feathers in her hair. SHE begins a stately descent. JOE puts his glass down and applauds. MAX watches discreetly, evidently moved; HE opens a bottle of champagne.<br/>JOE waits to meet her at the bottom of the stairs. HE&#x27;s reaching out to take her arm, when as if from nowhere, SHE suddenly produces a gold cigarette case and hands it to him.)<br/>NORMA<br/>Here. Happy New Year.<br/>JOE<br/>Norma, I can&#x27;t take this.<br/>NORMA<br/>Oh, shut up. Open it. Read what it says.<br/>(JOE opens it and reads out, half-amused and half-appalled.)<br/>JOE<br/>&quot;Mad about the boy&quot;<br/>NORMA<br/>Yes, and you do look absolutely divine.<br/>(JOE is touched, despite his embarrassment; HE decides to give in gracefully and slips the cigarette case into his pocket.)<br/>JOE<br/>Well, thank you.<br/>(NORMA stretches out a hand to lead JOE onto the freshly-waxed tiles dance-floor.)<br/>NORMA<br/>I had these tiles put in, you know, because Rudy Valentino said to me, it takes tiles to tango. Come on.<br/>JOE<br/>No, no, not on the same floor as Valentino!<br/>NORMA<br/>Oh come on, come on, come on. Get up. Follow me. And one, two.... and one, two, one, two together. And one.<br/>(THEY begin to dance. After a while, NORMA snaps at JOE.)<br/>Don&#x27;t lean back like that.<br/>JOE<br/>Norma, it&#x27;s that thing. It tickles.<br/>(NORMA pulls the feathers out of her hair and casts them aside. THEY resume dancing, closer this time.)<br/>NORMA<br/>Ring out the old<br/>Ring in the new<br/>A midnight wish<br/>to share with you<br/>Your lips are warm<br/>my head is light;<br/>were we alive<br/>before tonight?<br/>I don&#x27;t need a crowded ballroom<br/>everything I want is here<br/>If you&#x27;re with me<br/>next year will be<br/>the perfect year<br/>(JOE is beginning to be aware what&#x27;s happening; still, at the same time, HE&#x27;s caught up in the intoxication of the movement.)<br/>JOE<br/>Before we play<br/>some dangerous game;<br/>before we fan<br/>some harmless flame,<br/>we have to ask<br/>if this is wise<br/>and if the game<br/>is worth the prize.<br/>With this wine and with this music,<br/>how can anything be clear?<br/>Let&#x27;s wait and see<br/>it may just be<br/>the perfect year.<br/>(THEY dance.)<br/>NORMA<br/>It&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve<br/>and hope are high,<br/>Dance one year in,<br/>kiss one good-bye.<br/>Another chance,<br/>another start,<br/>so many dreams<br/>to tease the heart.<br/>We don&#x27;t need a crowded ballroom<br/>everything we want is here<br/>and face to face<br/>we will embrace<br/>the perfect year.<br/>We don&#x27;t need a crowded ballroom<br/>everything we want is here<br/>and face to face<br/>we will embrace<br/>the perfect year.<br/>(SHE kisses him lightly as the number comes to an end. Then, as the orchestra strikes up the next piece, THEY move off the floor to take up the glasses of champagne which MAX has poured for them. They clink glasses and drink.)<br/>JOE<br/>So, what time are they supposed to get here?<br/>NORMA<br/>Who?<br/>JOE<br/>The other guests.<br/>NORMA<br/>There are no other guests. Just you and me.<br/>(SHE leans in to kiss him again, this time more seriously. MAX half turns away, averting his eyes.)<br/>I&#x27;m in love with you. Surely you know that.<br/>(JOE is terribly startled by this.)<br/>JOE<br/>Norma....<br/>NORMA<br/>We&#x27;ll have a wonderful time next year. I&#x27;ll have the pool filled up for you. I&#x27;ll open up my house in Malibu, and you can have the whole ocean. I have enough money to buy us anything we want.<br/>JOE<br/>Cut out that &quot;us&quot; business.<br/>NORMA<br/>What&#x27;s the matter with you?<br/>JOE<br/>What right do you have to take me for granted?<br/>NORMA<br/>What right? Do you want me to tell you?<br/>(JOE is out of his depth now; all he can do is bluster.)<br/>JOE<br/>Norma, what I&#x27;m trying to say is that I&#x27;m the wrong guy for you; you need a big shot, someone with polo ponies, a Valentino...<br/>NORMA<br/>What you&#x27;re trying to say is, you don&#x27;t want me to love you. Say it! Say it!<br/>(JOE doesn&#x27;t answer; he looks away, avoiding her eye. Thus, it takes him a completely by surprise when SHE slaps his face. And, before HE can react, SHE&#x27;s turned and run all the way up the stairs to vanish into her bedroom. JOE finds himself standing face to face with MAX.)<br/>JOE<br/>Max. Get me a taxi.<br/>(As MAX moves towards the phone, the house moves back a way to reveal ARTIE&#x27;s apartment, a modest one-room affair, packed to the rafters with carefree young people, many of whom we have already encountered at the studio and at Schwab&#x27;s. Several of the GUESTS cluster around the piano and there&#x27;s a BOY with a saxophone. Others help themselves to some dangerous looking alcoholic concoction from a punchbowl. The house at Sunset remains visible throughout.<br/>As the new scene establishes itself, JOE encases himself in his vicuna coat.)<br/>I had to get out<br/>I needed<br/>to be with people my own age<br/>to hear the sound of laughter<br/>and mix with hungry actors,<br/>underemployed composers,<br/>nicotine-poisoned writers,<br/>real people,<br/>real problems,<br/>having a really good time.<br/>(JOE hesitates in the doorway of the apartment, suddenly embarrassed by how overdressed HE is. Meanwhile, ARTIE hails him and pushes through the crowd to greet him.)<br/>ARTIE<br/>Hey, Gillis! We&#x27;d given you up.<br/>(BETTY, by the piano, hears this and looks around, delighted to see JOE. By now, ARTIE has reached him.)<br/>Let me take your coat.<br/>(HE touches the coat and reacts, surprised.)<br/>Jesus, Joe, what&#x27;s this made of? Mink?<br/>(HE&#x27;s even more surprised when the coat comes off to reveal JOE&#x27;s tails.)<br/>Who did you borrow this from? Adolphe Menjou?<br/>JOE<br/>Close, but no cigar.<br/>(HE gestures around the room.)<br/>Hey! It&#x27;s quite a crowd.<br/>ARTIE<br/>I invited all the kids doing walk-ons in &quot;Samson and Delilah.&quot;<br/>BETTY<br/>Where have you been hiding? I called your apartment.
